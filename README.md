Introduction
This README provides an overview of two fundamental data structures: Stacks and Queues. These data structures are essential in computer science and are used to store and manage collections of items.

Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a stack of items, where you can only add or remove items from the top.

Queues
A queue is another linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed. It can be thought of as a waiting line, where the first person to join the line is the first to be served.

Stacks
Usage
Stacks are used in various applications, including but not limited to:

Expression Evaluation: Stacks are used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, such as infix to postfix conversion and postfix expression evaluation.

Function Calls: Stacks are used in programming languages to manage function calls and maintain a call stack.

Undo Operations: Many software applications use stacks to implement undo functionality.

Basic Operations for Stacks
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and retrieve the top element of the stack.
Peek (or Top): Retrieve the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
Size: Get the number of elements in the stack.
Queues
Usage
Queues find applications in various scenarios, including:

Task Scheduling: In operating systems, queues are used to manage processes waiting to be executed.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): In graph algorithms, queues help implement BFS traversal.

Print Queue: Printers use queues to manage print jobs.

Basic Operations for Queues
Enqueue: Add an element to the back (rear) of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove and retrieve the front element of the queue.
Front: Retrieve the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
Size: Get the number of elements in the queue.
